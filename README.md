# Google-Form-event-reservation

I wrote this script for my specific use case although it can be adapted to a general use case pretty easily. This script will automatically add calendar events based on a Google Form response. This form specifically serves to reserve a room in the on campus housing facility I live in on KU's campus. I figured I could save myself some time by using a script that already exists but upon some googling, I found nothing that quite suited my needs, so here we go!

The biggest feature this script supports is recurring events. You can specify the nature of your recurrence in the form and it will populate an event series in the calendar until the end of the semester. Moreover, this script also makes sure that there aren't any conflicts with another event while scheduling. The most useful thing that I was able to do was create a non-uniform event series using the `RecurrenceRule` class for Google Calendar. So say for example, you want to repeat an event biweekly but on some of those weeks there are other events that have already reserved a spot, the script can schedule an event series with holes in those conflicting weeks. It also uses the cache service for Google Apps Script to store the date for the end of the semester that I can fetch from the KU registrar's webpage.
